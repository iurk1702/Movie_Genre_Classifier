# NLP based movie genre classifier

This repository contains my implementation of a movie genre classifier(multi-label classification) which uses the Cornell movie dataset containing a large metadata-rich collection of fictional conversations extracted from raw movie scripts:

##  Metadata:

- 220,579 conversational exchanges between 10,292 pairs of movie characters
- involves 9,035 characters from 617 movies
- in total 304,713 utterances
- movie metadata included:
	- genres
	- release year
	- IMDB rating
	- number of IMDB votes
	- IMDB rating
- character metadata included:
	- gender (for 3,774 characters)
	- position on movie credits (3,321 characters)
